= NSIS Select Pop-Up Dialog
Robert Gill <rtgill82@gmail.com>

The *NSIS Select* plugin provides a simple modal pop-up dialog from which the
user may select from a list of items. It's far simpler to use than the
`nsDialog` plugin and doesn't require creating an entire custom installer page
when all you need is a simple combo box.


== Requirements

The UNICODE plugin requires at least NSIS 3.0. The ASCII plugin should work
with NSIS 2.xx. I haven't tested (much) at all with NSIS 2.xx, so if there are
issues using the plugin with that version, let me know.

== Build Requirements

The following are the requirements for building with GCC:

* http://www.cygwin.com[Cygwin]
* `mingw64-i686-gcc-core` (Cygwin package)
* `make` (Cygwin package)
* `unzip` or `p7zip` (Cygwin package; optional; for unpacking distribution)
* `p7zip` (Cygwin package; optional; for creating distribution packages (``make dist``))


== Cygwin Build Instructions

Install https://www.cygwin.com[Cygwin] including the `mingw64-i686-gcc-core`
compiler package, which should pull in `mingw64-i686-runtime`.

Then building should be as simple as running:

  make
